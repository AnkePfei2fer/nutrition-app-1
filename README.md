# Nutrition App

This repository is used as an exercise for the neuefische bootcamp `cgn-web-21-4`. The task is to get comfortable with [Component Driven Development](https://www.componentdriven.org/) using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for HTML and CSS/SCSS.

All components are based on [this Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/969050851928115321) design. Thanks to [@salman](https://www.figma.com/@salmanwap) for creating and sharing this UI Kit

## Getting Started

- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Run Storybook with `npm run storybook`.

## Tests

This repository validates your HTML, CSS/SCSS and JS code with [HTMLHint](https://htmlhint.com/), [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). You can call `npm run test` and/or install editor extensions.
